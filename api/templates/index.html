        <p><strong>How this API might help you?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Well, you are working on a project that deals with populations of
          different countries. Or, you may need to know the forest area
          percentage of different countries while writing a blog on
          <strong>Global warming</strong>. Similarly, you might be intereseted
          in how fast your countries GDP per capita is growing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If that's the case, this API might provide you with necessities. Given
          countries and years, this will fetch you pretty and customizable graph
          (with different themes) or a cool-looking table. They are returned as
          an HTML, so, you can easily embed them using iframe tag. Need raw
          data? We got you covered. Our '/json' endpoint will fetch you
          structured data which you can further use for development or ML
          purposes.
